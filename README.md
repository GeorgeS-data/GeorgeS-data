# Hey, I'm George

Iâ€™m a Durham University graduate with a Masterâ€™s in Mathematics (with Honours), passionate about using data to solve real-world problems. My final-year project involved hands-on credit risk analysis at Atom Bank, where I built statistical models and presented findings to senior credit risk managers.

Iâ€™m currently growing my portfolio with projects in healthcare analytics and trading bot development, and Iâ€™m actively looking for junior data analyst or data scientist roles â€” ideally remote or in northern England.
