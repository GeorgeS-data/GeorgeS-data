# Hey, I'm George

I'm a Durham University graduate with a master's in Mathematics and a strong interest in data analytics, statistical modelling, and solving real-world problems with data. My final-year project involved hands-on analysis of credit risk data from Atom Bank, where I developed and presented statistical models to support business decision-making.

I'm currently building my data portfolio and actively seeking junior data analyst or data scientist roles â€” ideally remote or based in northern England.
